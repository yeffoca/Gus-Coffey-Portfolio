## About me
I am a physics and astronomy researcher and student with a passion for data. I have accumulated skills in SQL, Python, machine learning and more. I enjoy using these skills in tandem with my problem solving and mathematical background to tackle novel questions about our world. In addition to my technical skills and hobbies I also love the outdoors. I am an avid freediver, hiker, and camper.
## Data Analysis Projects
### [Bike-Store-Analysis](https://github.com/yeffoca/Bike-Store-Analysis)
- **Description:** This project utilizes a PostgreSQL database to analyze the performance of three different bike stores. This analysis is then visualized using Tableau.
- **Skills:** PostgreSQL; DataGrip; Tableau; JOIN queries; sub-queries; aggregate functions

### [Salary-Predictions](https://github.com/yeffoca/Salary-Predictions)
- **Description:** This project utilizes Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras to predict the salary ranges of data analyst positions listed on Glassdoor.com.
- **Skills:** Python; TensorFlow; Keras; Scikit-learn; Seaborn; EDA; data reduction; data visualization

## Research Projects
### [Investigating the Correlation Between Galaxy Age and Morphology via JWST Observations](https://github.com/mekhi-woods/HSGCURIJWSTMorphology-repo)
- **Description:** This projects was funded by the NASA Space Grant Consortium. It is an ongoing project with the goal of using JWST NIRCAM images to measure galaxy morphology parameters such as asymmetry and Petrosian Radius. These parameters can then give us insight into galaxy evolution at high redshifts. Preliminary findings were presented as an iPoster at the 244th American Astronomical Society conference.
- **Skills:** Python; AstroPy; SciPy; SExtractor; data reduction; data visualization; team collaboration

### [HiloFiveO Lunar Soil Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IhjRUuQ1N7ffG0dMXggnEnMQhRUIU5UWDJ2C6lco2pw/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Description:** This was a smaller project that contributed to the [NASA Artemis Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/). The goal of this project was to find a correlation between the size lunar soil particulates and their level of weathering. Finding this correlation would help scientists better identify the age and history of the moon as well as other planetary bodies.
-  **Skills** Python; NumPy; Data Visualization; scientific method; team collaboration
